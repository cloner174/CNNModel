# Nodule Detection with PSO!

## Overview

This repository contains a multi-task deep learning model for nodule detection, capable of performing both classification and segmentation. It leverages **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** for hyperparameter optimization and loss weight tuning to enhance model performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pyswarms

## Installation

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pyswarms
```

## Usage

### Prepare Your Data:
Replace the placeholder data in run.py with your data.

### Run the Optimization and Training:

```bash
python run.py
```
